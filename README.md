# ATARI_NMPC
Atarilab NMPC

## Project Description
ATARI_NMPC is a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) framework designed for quadruped robots. It leverages the Acados solver for efficient optimization and Pinocchio for robot dynamics. The framework is modular, allowing easy adaptation to different quadruped robots by configuring URDF paths, gait parameters, and control settings.

### MPCCostConfig
Defines the cost parameters for the MPC:

- `W_base`: Running cost weights for base position, orientation, and velocity.
- `W_joint`: Running cost weights for joint positions and velocities.

- `reg_eps`: Regularization running cost.
- `reg_eps_e`: Regularization terminal cost.

## Main Script
The main script (`main.py`) initializes the simulation environment, loads the robot model, and sets up the MPC controller. It defines a `ReferenceVisualCallback` class for visualizing the reference trajectory and contact locations. The script runs the simulation for a specified duration and visualizes the results.

## MPC and Solver
The `LocomotionMPC` class in the `mpc_controller` module sets up the MPC controller using the provided configurations. It initializes the solver, sets up the reference trajectory, and updates the solver with the current state and contact plan. The `QuadrupedAcadosSolver` class in the `utils/solver.py` file extends the `AcadosSolverHelper` class to define the specific dynamics and cost functions for the quadruped robot.

## Implementing MPC on a New Robot
To implement the MPC on a new robot, follow these steps:
1. **Model**: Make sure that your MuJoCo and Pinocchio models can be loaded. The Pinocchio model should be without root joint as it will be added in the solver.
2. **Feet Frame Names**: Update the `feet_frame_names` parameter with the end-effector frame names of the new robot.
3. **Configurations**: Define a new `GaitConfig`, `MPCOptConfig`, `MPCCostConfig` with appropriate parameters for the new robot.
4. **Simulation Initialization**: Update the main script to load the new robot model and initialize the `LocomotionMPC` with the new configurations.

Use `print_info` argument of the MPC for debugging purposes.


## TODO

### Solver
- [ ] euler to tengent space orientation representation
- [ ] other contact model (e.g. humanoid feet)
- [ ] linearize cone constraint, see if performance improved
  
### Code optimzation
- [x] use acados `set_flat` to init the solver
- [ ] eventually C++ implementation

### MPC
- [ ] keyboard velocity control
- [ ] gait switching
- [ ] tune better `horizon`, `n_nodes`, and `qp_iter` in `MPCConfigOpt`. Seems that 1s horizon is too much.
- [ ] try with dt time optimization with `enable_time_opt = True` (this needs to be fixed)
- [ ] add new robots
